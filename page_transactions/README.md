The [Guará](https://github.com/douglasdcm/guara/blob/main/README.md) team selected this code to validate the following aspects of the framework:

    Page Transactions Pattern:
        The code is organized into a transaction class (WeatherPageTransaction) that encapsulates all the steps needed to interact with the weather page, including navigating to the page, extracting the temperature, and clicking the appropriate button based on the temperature.
        This encapsulation follows the Page Transactions Pattern, where a class represents a single unit of work (a "transaction") that can be reused across different tests.

    Modularity and Reusability:
        The WeatherPageTransaction and VerifyWeatherPage assertion are modular and reusable components. These components can be combined in different ways for other test scenarios, such as changing the URL or interacting with other page elements.

    Separation of Concerns:
        The framework encourages the separation of test actions (transactions) and assertions, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain. This approach is aligned with the Guará philosophy of ensuring that actions (such as interacting with a webpage) and validations (such as checking the current URL) are handled in separate classes.

    Readability and Orchestration:
        The Guará framework uses the Application class to orchestrate the tests, ensuring that each transaction is executed and assertions are made in a readable manner. The code is structured to ensure clarity and ease of understanding, especially for non-technical stakeholders or testers.

    Test Automation with Selenium:
        The code is a typical Selenium WebDriver test that interacts with a webpage, but with the additional benefit of using Guará to organize the test logic. The framework simplifies repetitive tasks, such as interacting with web elements and performing assertions, which improves both test efficiency and maintainability.

    Real-World Use Case:
        The test is a real-world example of automating user interaction with a webpage based on conditions (in this case, temperature). By testing this with Guará, the team shows how the framework can be applied to real-world UI automation scenarios, simplifying the process of handling conditional interactions and assertions.

    Framework Validation:
        By organizing this test using the Guará framework, the team demonstrates the ease of use, extensibility, and flexibility of the framework. This validation shows how Guará can be adapted for various types of automation tasks, beyond just the examples provided in the initial documentation.

Explanation of Code and Its Purpose
1. WeatherPageTransaction (Class WeatherPageTransaction):

    The WeatherPageTransaction class inherits from AbstractTransaction and implements the do method.
    The do method performs the core action of this transaction:
        Navigating to the weather webpage (self._driver.get).
        Extracting the temperature value from the element identified by the ID temperature.
        Checking if the temperature is greater than 19°C and clicking the appropriate button (Buy sunscreens or Buy moisturizers) based on that condition.
        Returning the current URL after the button is clicked. This URL is used for validation in the assertion phase.

2. Assertion (Class VerifyWeatherPage):

    This class implements the IAssertion interface and is responsible for verifying whether the result (the current URL) matches the expected URLs for the sunscreen or moisturizer pages.
    The asserts method is called to compare the current URL (result) with the expected values ("https://weathershopper.pythonanywhere.com/sunscreen" or "https://weathershopper.pythonanywhere.com/moisturizer").

3. Test Logic (Function test_weathershopper_temperature):

    The test_weathershopper_temperature function uses the Guará framework to organize the actions and assertions:
        The WeatherPageTransaction is invoked using app.at(WeatherPageTransaction, browser), which triggers the logic of navigating to the page and interacting with the elements.
        The VerifyWeatherPage assertion is applied to check if the current URL matches the expected results for sunscreen or moisturizer.

The Guará framework allows for clean separation of concerns, where the transaction (WeatherPageTransaction) handles interactions with the webpage, and the assertion (VerifyWeatherPage) verifies that the correct page is displayed after the transaction is completed.
Purpose of the Code Selection

Conclusion

This example was selected by the Guará team because it demonstrates the core benefits of the Page Transactions Pattern — modularity, reusability, and clear separation of concerns. It also shows how the framework can simplify test automation, making it easier to write maintainable and scalable UI tests while allowing for easy extension to new scenarios and validations.
